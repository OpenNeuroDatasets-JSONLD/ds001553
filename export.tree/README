Three subjects were scanned on a General Electric 3T MRI scanner. All subjects underwent 100 functional runs
, which consisted of five blocks of stimulation (20 s: flickering checkerboard at 8 Hz + letter/number discr
imination task) and 40 s of rest. For the letter/number discrimination task, subjects responded using a resp
onse box with their right hand.
